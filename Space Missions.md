# Space Missions Analysis

## Trends
From the 60s, until late 70s we observe an exponential raise of rocket launches with a peak of 119 in 1977. Starting with 1980 space operations have suffered a drastic downturn to a bottom of 37 launches in 2010 when we entered an even more aggressive uptrend than the 60s one reaching a high of 156 in 2021.

**Success Rate:** In the first years analyzed we notice success rates of below 50%. However, starting with 1964 the mission success rate has kept steadily above 80% and rarely below 90%. Taking into account the cost of building the rockets and the numerous tests and technology advancement we can infer that mission failures are extremely costly for space agencies and thus the high success rate.

## Activity analysis

As mentioned before there are two high activity period for space exploration in our history:
- **1960-1980**
  - Most successful missions have launched from Russia followed by Kazakhstan. The United States only took the third place with almost half the success missions of Russia (394 vs 728).

- **2010-2021**
  - After the “drought” period of space exploration the number of successful missions picked up again mainly because of USA. Over 339 space missions launched from American soil while the next competitor, China had only 224.

An interesting fact is that 177 of those US missions were organized by the private company SpaceX owned by Elon Musk.

## Other inferences
**Most used rocket** -> Cosmos-3M (11K65M) - 446 missions (Retired)

Launching locations are shared by multiple companies.
(i.e. NASA and SpaceX share the same launch location – Kennedy Space Center, Florida)
