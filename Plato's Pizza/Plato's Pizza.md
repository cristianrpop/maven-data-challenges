# Plato's Pizza Analytics

## Sales Activity

I have started the analysis by computing the total revenue, total orders and the total quantity of pizza ordered for the year in review.
Then I performed a monthly sales analysis. Sales were in a slight uptrend in the first 7 months, but there was a drawdown (about 10%) in Q4.

To find out the peak periods of activity I have drilled down the quantity of pizza ordered by weekday and by time of day. The result was quite conclusive - the peak period is on Fridays
at noon between 12-14 and in the evening between 17-19. Thus I have proceeded to calculate:
- Average hourly pizza production during peak periods. 
- Peak average pizzas/table (we know our pizza place has 15 tables with a total of 60 seats)
- Peak average capacity utilization (taking into account an average of 1 pizza/seat, ~19.18 seats are utilized in peak hours)

Had a look at how the sales are divided by pizza category. The clientele seems to be divided more or less equally between the four categories with the Classic pizza leading.

Last but not least I have analyzed the best and worst selling pizzas. The best selling pizza produced sales about 29 times of the worst selling pizza. 

## Recommendations

- My suggestion for the owner is to analyze the ingredients used in the worst selling pizzas and make a comparison with the costs associated with keeping the pizza types on the menu. 
- Then, decide if it is better to remove them from the menu.
- Increase price of best-selling pizzas and see how the sales react. Of course a competitor pricing strategy analysis should be made beforehand.
- Create "buy two, one is free" offers to maximize capacity
